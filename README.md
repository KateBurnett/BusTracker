# Real Time Bus Tracker
## MIT Bus Tracker Coding Exercise
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Our task in this activity was to create a bus tracker that interfaces with real-time municipal tracking data for buses and shows the location of that bus on a map.<br>
<br>
<b>How to Run:</b> Load the html document on your browser window and the bus tracking will automatically begin.<br>
<br>
<b>Future improvements:</b> Future iterations will display all buses on the chosen route with separate markers.<br>
